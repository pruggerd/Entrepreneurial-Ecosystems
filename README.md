# Entrepreneurial-Ecosystems
#### Spatial maps consisting of the entrepreneurial ecosystem index and existence of gazelles for all provinces in the Netherlands 2009 - 2015. Part 3 is a heatmap of all provinces concerning their entrepreneurial power

The R file (Entr-Business.R) creates all maps and loads the data files. The resulting output are three spatial maps showcasing how well of 
the entrepreneurial ecosystems of the Netherlands are for each province. For the maps itself, see the files "Index 2009" to "Index 2015". 
The second string of visualization showcases the amount of highly successfull startups (Gazelles) for each province of the Netherlands. 
"Heatmap" shows a heatmap consisting of more detailled indicators of entrepreneurial ecosystems for the Netherlands. The data itself was obtained from a profesor of mine, I am not authorized 
to circulate the data. Please contact me if you wish to obtain/recreate the data. The R script only works with the original data of course.
